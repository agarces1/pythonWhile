#while loops can be used instead of for loops
import turtle
counter = 0
while counter < 4:
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.right(90)
    counter = counter+1 #or += 1 will work the same way
#answer = '0'
#while answer !='42':
#    answer = input('What is the meaning of life?');
#print('Congrats you are right!!');
#While loop make sure your condition changes
#use for loops when ever possible
#dont fear the while loop, They are used to read data until no data.
